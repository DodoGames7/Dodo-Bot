$description[1;this rewrite version is coded in Aoi.js and it's currently in Development, this rewrite aims to be alternative to BDFD and it's restrictions as well as this allows me to make unlimited commands and make the bot really 24 hours online without having to renew hosting time in BDFD, but it's also open source this time and anyone can self host it with their very own custom bot, stay tuned for Updates! ❤️]
