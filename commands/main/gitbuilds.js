While usually new features or changes are introduced, there may be also bugs considering that this is a unfinished build which is why it's unrecommended for public use or to be used on public bots.
    
    Github Builds are obtainable through the branch [gitbuilds](https://github.com/dodogames7/Dodo-Bot/tree/gitbuilds).]
