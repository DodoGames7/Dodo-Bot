$title[Use of Source code]
$addField[For public bots;If creating a modified instance of Dodo-Bot that is public, then it is recommended to give credit to the original work done by me in this project. 

While that may not stop you from claiming that the work is supposedly done by yours, it would be respectful for me as a person spending his time coding on his personal project.]
$addField[For private bots;If you're going to host Dodo-Bot (or have a modified instance) for specific private servers, then giving credit is optional as private bots aren't a big deal to me (using the project for also learning is fine). 

You may still give credit in cases where you claim it's your work.]
