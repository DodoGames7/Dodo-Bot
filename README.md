# Dodo-Bot
A personal bot project made in ForgeScript aiming to both entertain and provide users some features to use.

# What is this
Dodo-Bot is a personal project that existed since late 2021. It was mainly made for entertainment and such. It was mostly made with the goal mindset of reducing the number of bots needed to do each stuff.

This version of the bot aka rebase is based on the CupcakeX codebase albeit with improvements and new stuff for the sake of learning. Despite this, it's made as a rebase backup if aoi.js was to ever die one day.

# Rebase
Rebase is a special version of Dodo-Bot intended for disastrous situations such as aoi.js suddenly dying one day. In general, it is good to rebase your project for another library so that you always have anything prepared in place which is why this version of Dodo-Bot exists. It is similar to v2 but with using ForgeScript which is a mix between aoi and bdfd.

During the earlier development, it was originally going to be Dodo-Bot v3 before it was decided that v3 would be repurposed for aoi.js v7 instead. As a result, you will find things that did not exist in v2 such as Leveling exclusion feature for example.

It's also used to try new techniques before being ported to the non-Rebase version of the bot!

# Versions
* **[V1](https://github.com/DodoGames7/Dodo-Bot/tree/v1)**: The discontinued version of Dodo-Bot. It had a bad start with bunch of bugs due to me being newbie in aoi.js at the time.
