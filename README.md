# Dodo-Bot
[WIP]: a discord multipurpose aoi.js bot that aims to be improving user experience with discord servers

# self hosting
before running the bot by self hosting the bot, you agree to not to:

1. sell the code

2. reproduce the code, and claiming that you made it (i know you want to flex on your friends but at least give credit to the original work done by me)

3. using it for bad purposes

4. advertising the bot on any platforms such as top.gg, discordbotlist, etc, as i will be taken them down by reporting them to bot list staff

however you are allowed to:

1. give credits if you've used my commands

2. reporting bugs in the bot
