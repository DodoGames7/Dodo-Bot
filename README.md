# dodo bot v2
an bot that aims to make your discord experience look easier per Every Guild

# disclaimer
the development on this will take sometime cuz v6-dev is missing a lot of functions which should have been added before (as well as variables being hasn't added)

# the story
v2 was supposed to be discord.js-based bot but due to some issues, it has been made use aoi.js v6, even though almost every release of dodo bot were bugged having a lot of bugs (including early releases of v1 tbh), this release aims to make everything as much as simple as it was before, this bot (with v2 update) is likely made for you to learn as well as enjoy it, it's probably the first aoi.js v6 bot to be open sourced here, although as aoi.js v6 isn't ready for public, bugs are expected from either the bot code or on aoi.js devs side, so do not use unless you want to take risks

# credits
most of code belongs to me, you can also credit me using my tag: dodoGames#7509 in case using my code for development purposes, you really agree to not to claim that you made it otherwise i may ask you to credit, anything involves in violating credits (including making any bot public using this code) is not allowed
