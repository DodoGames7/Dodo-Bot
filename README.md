# disclaimer

# Dodo-Bot
[WIP]: a discord multipurpose aoi.js bot that aims to be improving user experience with discord servers

# self hosting
before running the bot by self hosting the bot, you agree to not to:

1. sell the code

2. reproduce the code, and claiming that you made it (i know you want to flex on your friends but at least give credit to the original work done by me)

3. using it for bad purposes

4. advertising the bot on any platforms such as top.gg, discordbotlist, etc, as i will be taken them down by reporting them to bot list staff

however you are allowed to:

1. give credits if you've used my commands

2. reporting bugs in the bot


# running the bot
this bot supports both glitch and replit, you can also deploy it to [Railway](https://railway.app) or heroku to make the bot running 24 hours online, before doing any of these, you should know on how tu use glitch or replit or Railway, otherwise there will be no support for non-related issue there,

reminder: if you have deployed the bot to railway or heroku, then be aware that any data the bot stored it (such as custom prefix, etc) will be reseted automatically next time the bot code is redeployed, you can use hosts like glitch or replit to avoid this (does not apply to discord bot hosting companies, VPS Hosts), optionally, you could also run `(prefix)eval $readFile[database/main/main_scheme_1.sql]` to view database data, so you can backup your stuff before re deploying

if you're using glitch, replit:

when cloning the bot code from this repo, add a variable named `TOKEN` to .env file, you can also change the custom prefix in the variables file, in fact you're free to change anything in the bot code as long as you know what are you doing

if you're using railway:

Dodo Bot supports Railway as well as a template to the bot, you can click here if you don't want to manually do steps and host it

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/O6clYk?referralCode=88DGWn)

NOTE: if you replaced `process.env.TOKEN` with your token, then you're risking having your bot hacked by a random users, to prevent this, do not remove it, also make sure you're running node.js v16 as this bot will not work with older versions of node

# reporting bugs
if you have a problem or some broken stuff you found, then you're welcome to open a pull request, before opening, make sure to double check if your fix is working, and if everything works fine then you can go ahead to open a pr request (i will also give credits if you got approved)

# branches
* **djs-v13** - experimental version of the bot, slash command only
* **main** - deprecated, should not be used
* **beta** - a branch which prepares upcoming versions of the bot, usually had bugs but a preview of new features, fixes, etc
* **final** - actively maintained and up to date with aoi.js changes
