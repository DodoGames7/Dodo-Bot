# dodo bot v2
An bot that tries to entertain people as much as Possible.

# it's no longer multi-purpose?
Yes, but there is an reason for that. When i first started Dodo-Bot Project, i thought everything was easy, but i was wrong. Maintaining Dodo-Bot v1 was absolutely painful since you have to fix the apis not working in the commands most all of the time which can be truly annoying if there is only one person working on a huge bot project. As time went on, I began to lose my interest at maintaining the bot since i was busy with school and such. Eventually, I discontinued v1 meaning that it won't be updated anymore. However, as days went on, i began to think on changing the purpose of the bot to be much easier for my development and so this is how v2 was officially brought back to life, started from scratch and no longer being multi-purpose but at least, an fun bot.

# the story
v2 was supposed to be discord.js-based bot but due to some issues, it has been made use aoi.js v6, even though almost every release of dodo bot were bugged having a lot of bugs (including early releases of v1 tbh), this release aims to make everything as much as simple as it was before, this bot (with v2 update) is likely made for you to learn as well as enjoy it, it's probably the first aoi.js v6 bot to be open sourced here, although as aoi.js v6 isn't ready for public, bugs are expected from either the bot code or on aoi.js devs side, so do not use unless you want to take risks

# credits
most of code belongs to me, you can also credit me using my tag: dodoGames#7509 in case using my code for development purposes, you really agree to not to claim that you made it otherwise i may ask you to credit, anything involves in violating credits (including making any bot public using this code) is not allowed
